#<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Objectives</span>

You may have encountered the idea of popular sovereignty in a civics or political science course.  This means that the people rule, as opposed to a monarch, dictator, clique of oligarchs, religious authorities, etc.  When it comes to the economy, it is often said that consumers are sovereign.  Consumer sovereignty is the idea that consumer choices rule the economy.   A firm that provides a product or service that better meets consumer wants and needs is likely to succeed and be profitable.  A firm that fails to do so will not remain in business very long, or so the theory goes.  Evidence that businesses recognize the importance of consumer sovereignty is provided by placards common in many workplaces reminding employees that "the customer is always right."  This notion is also encapsulated in the Latin phrase, *De gustibus non disputatum est*, which translates into English as "tastes are not disputable".  

Consumer sovereignty helps explain the breadth of production and marketing activities observed in the economy.  To illustrate, consider children's breakfast cereals.  Lots of money is spent on the packaging and promotion of these products.  Even if it can be assumed that these cereals are good for children, a critic might argue that everyone would be better off if an entity was set up to simply take flour from oats, rice, corn, or wheat; add sugar and a binding agent; pellet it; and distribute it to families with children.  Children would get the same nutrition regardless of whether there was a friendly looking pirate on the box and a cheap toy inside.  The critic could argue that all the money that is spent on promoting these products is wasteful and contributes nothing to the nutritional well-being of children.  These resources could instead be better used for a worthwhile cause like cancer research or public education.  This critic may have a point, but consumer sovereignty suggests that if parents continue to vote with their purchases in favor of branded breakfast cereals  (or if children have the power to influence their parents to do so), breakfast cereal companies will exist to meet this demand.

If consumers are sovereign, then it is probably a good idea to consider models of consumer behavior in a course like this.  The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of some economic theories of the consumer.  The first section addresses the neoclassical theory of the consumer.  Two extensions of this theory that have particular resonance in food markets are covered next.  One is Lancaster's (1966) model, which emphasizes products as delivery mechanisms for characteristics. The other, Becker's (1965) model, theorizes that market-sourced products are inputs for household production activities.  All three of three of these models -- the Neoclassical model, Lancaster's model, and Becker's model -- are based on the idea that consumers are rationale. They know what they want and what is available.  Moreover they can make choices that are best for them given what they are able to afford. The primary objectives of this chapter are as follows:  

* Explain the main logic of consumer choice theory in terms of preferences and budget sets.

* Graph budget sets and budget frontiers, given price and income data, and explain what happens to the budget set as prices and/or income change.

* Outline the basic assumptions required for well-behaved preferences.  Given a specific example, be able to determine whether these assumptions are satisfied.

* Describe the difference between ordinal utility and cardinal utility.

* Graphically derive individual demand functions.

* Diagram efficient consumption frontiers (Lancaster-type budget constraints) and identify products that are and are not competitive.

* Analyze how changes in price, income, and product characteristics affect consumer choice in Lancaster's framework.

* Describe hedonic pricing models and identify characteristics to be included in a hedonic pricing model for a given
product.

* Derive the full-time income constraint of Becker's model.

* Use the logic of Becker's model to explain consumer valuation of time-saving (convenience) built into food products.

* Use the logic of Lancaster's and Becker's models to analyze trends in food consumption.

#<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Neoclassical Consumer Theory</span>

The basic idea behind consumer choice theory is very simple: The consumer seeks to obtain the best bundle of goods and services that he or she possibly can (Varian 1993). This is true of the neoclassical theory covered in this section as well as the extension to the theory to be described below.  In deciding what is the best bundle of goods and services, economists generally assume that the consumer has preferences that can be represented by a utility function.  The utility function assigns a number to a given bundle of goods and services.  A bundle that the consumer likes more is assigned a higher number.  A bundle that the consumer likes less is assigned a lower number.  A utility function formalizes the idea that consumers have the ability to rank various bundles of goods and services in terms of their desirability. 

Preferences represented by a utility function determine the "best" bundle of goods and services.  However, think carefully about the fundamental idea that a consumer chooses the best bundle of goods and services that he or she possibly can.  The "possibly can" part of the idea is very important.  A consumer's best bundle might include several multimillion-dollar homes: one at a ski resort in the Rockies or Alps, one on the north shore of Lake Superior (for summer months), and one in the Virgin Islands (for winter months when not on the ski slopes).  Of course, the best bundle would also include a private jet to take the consumer wherever he or she fancied.   Very few people could obtain this best bundle.  This is because the dollars consumers have to spend is limited by their available income.

We could reformulate our fundamental idea in terms of economic jargon as follows:  consumers maximize their utility subject to a budget or income constraint.  The utility function determines what is best.  The budget or income constraint determines the set of possible bundles that the consumer can obtain.

### Budget Sets in the Neoclassical Model

The __*budget set*__ contains all combinations of goods that the consumer can afford.  In this course, simple budget sets that include only two goods will be used.  Such a simplification may not work well in empirical applications using real-world data because each consumer probably has hundreds, if not thousands, of possible goods in their budget set (just think about the wide variety of goods available in any supermarket, department store, or online retailer).  However, all models are simplifications, and in terms of understanding consumer choice behavior, a two-good world can get you a long way.  With a simple two-good world you can develop an understanding of the essential logic of the consumer choice model.  Simplifying the world to only two goods also allows the consumer's choice space to be represented graphically (as in Demonstration 1 below).

Algebraically, the budget set is defined over the quantities of the two goods, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ as all pairs: 
$$\{Q_1,Q_2\} : P_1 Q_1 + P_2 Q_2 \le M,$$
where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are prices of goods 1 and and 2, respectively, and $M$ is the consumer's income.  The budget set simply states that the amount spent on good 1 plus the amount spent on good 2 must be less than the consumer's income.

The __*budget frontier*__ consists of those bundles that completely exhaust the consumer's income.  In the expression for the budget set above, replace the inequality with an equal sign and you have those points that comprise the budget frontier.  Because $Q_2$ will be on the vertical axis this expression for $Q_2$.  This is the equation for the budget frontier:

$$Q_2 = \frac{M}{P_2}-\frac{P_1}{P_2} Q_1.$$

An example budgets set is presented in Demonstration 1.  Note that this is a line with a vertical intercept of $\frac{M}{P_2}$ and a slope of $-\frac{P_1}{P_2}$.  

There is an easy way to graph the budget set in a two-good economy.  The vertical intercept is where the consumer spends all of his or her income on good 2.  You only need to ask how many units of good 2 the consumer could afford if the entire budget went to good 2.  The answer is $\frac{M}{P_2}$.  The horizontal intercept can similarly be found be asking how many units of good 1 could be obtained if the consumer spend all his/her money on good 1, which is $\frac{M}{P_1}$.  Thus if you know $M$, $P_1$, and $P_2$, you can, in a matter of seconds, graph the consumer's budget frontier.  Simply divide $M$ by $P_2$ to get your vertical intercept, divide $M$ by $P_1$ to get your horizontal intercept, and connect the dots.  It is as easy as that!  You now have your frontier.  The budget set is comprised of the points on the frontier and the points south and west of the frontier.

First, use Demonstration 1 to see what happens to the budget set when $P_1$ and/or $P_2$ changes. Start by increasing one of the prices, $P_1$ or $P_2$, but not both.  The price increase changes the slope of the frontier because the intercept for the axis with the now higher-priced good moves towards the origin.  The entire budget set becomes smaller.  You will see a triangular area comprised of points that the consumer was able to afford before the price increase but can no longer afford afterwards.  Now, go ahead and increase the other price as well.  This further contracts the budget set.  Finally, set the prices back to their initial values.  Repeat the process for a price decrease and note what happens to the budget set.  The takeaway here is that price changes affect both the size of the budget set and slope of the budget frontier.

Second, use Demonstration 1 to evaluate a change in income ($M$).  Decrease the consumer's income in the demonstration and notice that both the vertical and horizontal intercepts contract towards the origin.  The budget frontier line makes a parallel shift to the southwest.  The entire budget set becomes smaller.  Repeat the process for an increase in income and note what happens to the budget set.  The conclusion to be drawn is that a change in income affects the size of budget set but not the slope of the budget frontier.

### Preferences in the Neoclassical Model
A budget set identifies what bundles are affordable to a consumer.  The fundamental idea behind consumer theory is that a consumer will choose the best bundle from this set.  Just what this "best" bundle is depends on the consumer's preferences.  To facilitate a discussion of preferences, it will be useful to introduce some preference relations that we can use to indicate how the consumer views different bundles.  These relations are defined in Table 1.

***

#### Table 1. Preference Relations

Relation | Name              | Example       | Interpretation
---------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------------
$\approx$|Indifference       | $x \approx y$ | $x$ is indifferent to $y$
$\succeq$|Weakly preferred   | $x \succeq y$ | $x$ is at least as good as $y$
$\succ$  |Strictly preferred | $x \succ y$   | $x$ is better than $y$

***

### Representing Preferences Graphically
In introductory microeconomics, you probably learned about indifference curves (they might also have been called iso-utility curves).  Figure 1 presents indifference curves that represent a consumer's preferences.  Each labeled point in Figure 1 represents a bundle of the two goods.  The curves are called indifference curves because they represent bundles that the consumer likes equally well.  Unless, you are instructed otherwise, you are to assume that points on indifference curves to the northeast are increasingly preferred.  For instance, E is preferred to all labeled bundles on this diagram because it lies on the indifference curve that is furthest northeast.  Based on Figure 1, it is possible to make the following statement about the five labeled bundles:

$$E \succ D \approx C \succ B \approx A.$$

Given the preference relations defined above, the following are also true, although less precise, statements of the preference ordering for the consumer with the preference map in Figure 1:

$$E \succeq D \succeq C \succeq B \succeq A,$$
and
$$E \succeq C \succeq D \succeq A \succeq B.$$

### Utility Functions

A preference map, such as that in Figure 1, is a two-dimensional representation of a utility function.  The important thing about a utility function is that it assigns numbers that indicate the consumer's strength of preference for a given bundle.  If the consumer likes bundle C more than bundle A, then a utility function would assign a higher number to bundle C and a lower number to bundle A.  If the consumer likes bundle B just as much as bundle A, then the utility function would assign the same number to both bundles A and B.  There is an important concept here.  This concept is that a utility function provides an __*ordinal*__ (not __*cardinal*__) ranking of preferences.  With an ordinal utility function, one does not particularly care about the utility number itself, only that higher numbers are assigned to bundles the consumer likes more, lower numbers to bundles the consumer likes less, and that the same number is assigned to bundles the consumer likes equally well. 

Figure 2 depicts a utility function.  The function is in blue tones and shows the level of utility corresponding to different combinations of goods 1 and 2.  The horizontal plane in the figure, depicted in green, intersects the utility function at a specified height.  The intersection between the plane and function provides all combinations of goods 1 and 2 that provide the consumer with level of utility equal to the height of the plane.  If you were to look at the utility function directly from above, you would see that the intersection of the plane with the function maps out an indifference curve.  Thus, an indifference curve map, such as that shown in Figure 1, is actually a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional phenomenon.  Each indifference curve depicts a given height on the utility function.

###Assumptions About Preferences
There are several assumptions that are commonly made about preferences.  These assumptions simplify the consumer's choice problem and also result in individual demand equations that conform to the law of demand. 

**Preferences are complete.** If preferences are complete, it means that the consumer is able to rank bundles.  This is not unreasonable assumption in most cases.  If you were given a choice between two packages of almonds with one apple (bundle A) or one package of almonds with two apples (bundle B), you could probably indicate which bundle you most preferred or whether you were indifferent between the two.

**Preferences are transitive.** Transitive preferences simply mean that if $C \succeq B$, and $B \succeq A$, then it must be that $C \succeq A$.  Like completeness, transitivity is a fairly straightforward assumption.  The transitivity assumption assures that indifference curves will never intersect one another.

That preferences are **reflexive** and **continuous** are additional basic assumptions about preferences which are important to formal mathematical treatment of consumer theory but are of less practical importance in a course like this.  The important thing is that if preferences are complete, transitive, reflexive, and continuous; there is an ordering of preferences that can be represented by a utility function (Varian 1992).  It is common to make two additional assumptions about preferences and these are of more practical importance in this course.  The first is that preferences are convex and the second is that preferences are monotonic. 

**Preferences are convex.**  Convexity is a common assumption made about preferences.  Given (1) the consumer likes bundle A exactly as much as bundle B ($A \approx B$), and (2) bundle A is not the same bundle as bundle B ($A \ne B$), preferences are strictly convex if the consumer prefers an average bundle $C = 0.5 A + 0.5 B$ to either bundle A or B by itself.  Convexity implies that consumers like to have variety in their consumption.  Another way to say this is that "means are preferred to extremes."  

In most cases, convexity is a reasonable assumption. It is actually hard to come up with cases where convexity might not hold.  Suppose, for example, that a consumer likes cocktail olives and that the consumer also like chocolate ice cream.  However, ice cream does not pair well with olives and so the the consumer does not like to have cocktail olives with his/her ice cream.  In this case, you might argue that the consumer would prefer an extreme bundle (all cocktail olives or all ice cream) to a mean bundle (some cocktail olives and some ice cream) and his or her preferences would not be convex.  This example is a bit stretched, however.  It assumes that that the consumer would somehow be forced to eat cocktail olives and ice cream at the same time.  Why could he or she not eat the ice cream now and save the olives for later?  Over the course of the day, the consumer may want to have something sweet with lunch (ice cream) and something savory with supper (cocktail olives).  Thus, even though he or she does not like cocktail olives and ice cream at the same time, preferences are still convex because the consumer likes a variety of sweet and savory foods over the course of a day.  

**Preferences are monotonic.** The second additional assumption is that preferences are monotonic.  Monotonicity simply means that the consumer prefers bundles with more goods to bundles with less.  Given two bundles, bundles A and B, monotonicity means the consumer prefers B to A if:

1.	B contains at least as much of each good as does A, and 

2.	B contains strictly more of at least one good than does A.  

Is monotonicity a reasonable assumption?  At first glance it would seem that it is not because there are some goods where too much of a good becomes a bad.  For example, after eating two sandwiches, the consumer could be sick, literally, if forced to eat a third. That said, an argument can be made that monotonicity is a very reasonable assumption for models of the consumer.  This is because consumers make market choices only in regions where their preferences are monotonic.  For example, if a consumer is waiting in line to purchase a sandwich it is a pretty good assumption that an additional sandwich is something he or she wants and that preferences are monotonic at least with respect to one more sandwich.  In short, consumers are only in the market when they want more of a good or when they have monotonic preferences for the good in question. The goal of the consumer model is to provide a reasonable approximation to what occurs in the real world.  If, in the real world, consumers are only making choices in regions where monotonicity holds, then it is a reasonable to assume monotonicity for preferences used in the consumer model.

###Choice in the Neoclassical Model

Having covered budget sets and preferences in some detail, let us now return to the basic idea of consumer theory: Consumers choose the best bundle of goods and services that they possibly can.  The "best" part of the idea is given by preferences.  The "possibly can" part of the idea is determined by budget sets.  In the parlance of the model, the consumer's problem is to achieve the highest indifference curve possible given the budget set.  

Figure 3 provides a graphical illustration of the consumer's choice problem.  Points A, B, and C are on the frontier of the budget set.  At each of these points, the consumer is exhausting all of his/her income.  Only point C, however, is optimal.  Given convexity, point C is preferred to either A or B.  As a result, our utility function places point C on a higher indifference curve.  In fact, it is not possible to find a point within the consumer's budget set that is preferred to point C.  Thus, point C is the best bundle that the consumer can afford.  At point C, the indifference curve is tangent to the budget frontier line.

axis(1, at=c(0,12), labels=c("",""),lwd.ticks=1)
axis(2, at=c(0,12), labels=c("",""),lwd.ticks=1)
```

####Figure 3. Point C is the consumer's optimal choice.  If preferences are strictly monotonic and strictly convex, the optimal choice occurs where the indifference curve is tangent to the budget frontier line.

Again, Figure 3 is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional phenomenon.  Figure 4, depicts the utility function (blue-toned surface).  The yellow-toned vertical plane intersecting the utility function is the budget constraint.  The consumer cannot afford points and corresponding levels of utility that lie to the right of this vertical budget plane.  The consumer's goal is to reach the highest elevation on the utility function possible.  In Figure 4, this highest level is shown by the purple point.  The green-toned horizontal plane is set to the elevation of the affordable point that provides the greatest utility.  If the model were to be viewed directly from above, this three-dimensional model would look very similar to the two-dimensional model in Figure 3.  You would see an indifference curve that is created by the intersection of the green horizontal plane and the utility function.  This indifference curve would just touch the vertical budget plane at the optimal point.

###Individual Demand Curves

The theory of consumer choice, the idea that the consumers seek the highest point on their utility function given an affordability constraint, can be used to generate demand curves.  This is illustrated in Demonstration 2 below.  Notice that as $P_1$ increases, the consumer's budget set becomes smaller and his or her optimal choice changes to include a smaller amount of $Q_1$.  Conversely as $P_1$ decreases, the consumer's budget set becomes larger and his or her optimal choice includes a larger amount of $Q_1$.  The lower panel of the demonstration depicts a mapping of the optimal choices of $Q_1$ corresponding to different levels of $P_1$, holding $P_2$ and $M$ constant.  The result is a nice, downward sloping, demand schedule.  As you change the value of $P_1$ in the demonstration, be sure to note the relationship between the the choice model in the upper panel and the demand schedule in the lower panel.  

Anything aside from own-price that effects the budget sets or the preference map shifts the individual demand curve.  For example, in Demonstration 2, you can change the level of income.  As you do this, notice that the budget set changes and the demand curve shifts.  In general, any variable, aside from own-price, that affects the budget set or that effects the preference map will shift the individual's demand schedule.

#<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Lancaster's (1966) Characteristics Model</span>

In the neoclassical model of consumer choice described above, the consumer has preferences that can be represented by a utility function.  The solution to the consumer's choice involves a constrained optimization problem wherein the consumer seeks the bundle that returns the highest utility possible given his or her budget set.  The benefit of the neoclassical model is that it provides a framework for examining the role of price changes, income changes, and (in some cases) preference changes on consumer behavior.  You saw in Demonstration 2, for example, that given some reasonable assumptions, the solution to the neoclassical choice model results in demand functions that are downward sloping in own-price and that could depend on prices of related substitute and complement goods as well as consumer income.

An alternative formulation of the consumer's choice problem is provided by Lancaster (1966).  This model is similar to the neoclassical model in that it relies on the same basic premise:  Consumers seek the best bundle of goods given an affordability constraint.  However, it differs from the neoclassical model in terms of how preferences and budget sets are formulated.

### Preferences in the Lancaster Model
The essential difference in the Lancaster model is that the consumer views a purchased good as a bundle of characteristics.  For example, the consumer is not interested in a half gallon of orange juice *per se*.  Rather he or she is interested in characteristics such as vitamin C, potassium, a sweet and tart taste sensation, carbohydrates for energy, dietary fiber, etc.  The consumer could satisfy the desire for these characteristics through orange juice or through several other products.  For example, grapefruit juice might provide similar micro-nutrient characteristics to orange juice but would differ in terms of the taste characteristics provided (less sweet with a slightly bitter aftertaste) and macro-nutrients (perhaps slightly fewer calories).  Concord grape juice would lack the tartness of orange juice, provide a taste sensation that is more sweet, would likely contain more calories, provide more or less of certain micro-nutrients, and would provide a mouth-feel different from either orange juice or grapefruit juice.  The point to be made here is that orange juice, grapefruit juice, and Concord grape juice are more than just products, they are delivery mechanisms for a variety of characteristics that the consumer may value.

### Utility in the Lancaster Model
In Lancaster's model, the consumer has preferences that can be represented by a utility function.  However, preferences and utility levels are defined in terms of characteristics of purchased goods and services.  A utility function in Lancaster's framework can be defined as follows:

$$U = f(c_{11},c_{12},c_{13},\ldots,c_{1N},c_{21},c_{22},c_{23},\ldots,c_{2N},\ldots,c_{M1},c_{M2},c_{M3},\ldots,c_{MN}),$$

where $c_{ij}$ is the amount of the $i^{th}$ characteristic contained in one unit of the $j^{th}$ purchased good, $i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, M$ and $j = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, N$.

For example, it would be possible to identify and measure characteristics in three juice products: orange juice ($Q_1$) , grapefruit juice ($Q_2$), and Concord grape juice ($Q_3$).  Suppose, for simplicity, that consumers care only about two characteristics: sweetness (characteristic 1) and tartness (characteristic 2).  In this case, the $c_{ij}$ terms in the consumer's utility function would be interpreted as follows:

* $c_{11}$ = the amount of characteristic 1 (sweetness) in product 1 (orange juice)
* $c_{12}$ = the amount to characteristic 1 (sweetness) in product 2 (grapefruit juice)
* $c_{13}$ = the amount of characteristic 1 (sweetness) in product 3 (Concord grape juice)

* $c_{21}$ = the amount of characteristic 2 (tartness) in product 1 (orange juice)
* $c_{22}$ = the amount characteristic 2 (tartness) in product 2 (grapefruit juice)
* $c_{23}$ = the amount of characteristic 2 (tartness) in product 3 (Concord grape juice)

The formulation of preferences in the Lancaster model clearly has implications for product design and marketing.  Within one single product, there can be the opportunity to adjust characteristics being offered to consumers with different tastes.  For example, consider ready-to-serve orange juice in the typical supermarket. You will see variations in terms of pulp, whether the product is from concentrate, and whether the product has been fortified with other nutrients not naturally found in orange juice (e.g., calcium).  Basically, food marketers understand that altering the characteristics of a product can make it more attractive to certain consumer segments.  

The Lancaster model does assume that the characteristics that are of interest to consumers can be measured.  In many cases, this would be straightforward.  For example, consider an automobile. Characteristics that might be important to the consumer include horsepower, fuel efficiency, head room, leg room, number of doors, whether the vehicle is four-wheel drive, and so forth.  Some characteristics that are important to the consumer such as reliability and smoothness of ride might be more difficult to measure. However, there are third-party entities that provide ratings for experience characteristics like reliability and handling.  Moreover, the consumer will generally test drive the vehicle to assess some of these characteristics before purchase.  In the case of food products, sensory labs with specialized equipment and trained sensory panelists can provide quantitative measures of characteristics such as texture, firmness, mouth-feel, aftertastes, and other attributes of the product.

### Budget Sets in the Lancaster Model
Provided that characteristics can be measured, it is possible to construct a budget constraint for the Lancaster model.  Remember that in the Lancaster model, consumers care about characteristics.  Purchased goods matter to the consumer only because of the characteristics contained therein.  In other words, utility is derived indirectly from purchased goods and services.  This being the case, the budget constraint for Lancaster's model needs to reflect the amount of characteristics the consumer can afford.  

Figure 5 provides a diagram of a Lancaster-type budget set for two characteristics.  Following the earlier conventions, let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be the prices of products 1 and 2, respectively, and let M be the consumer's budget.  Notice that in Figure 5, the characteristics are on the vertical and horizontal axis.  The consumer cannot buy characteristics directly, but obtains characteristics by purchasing products 1 and 2.  Thus, the affordable amounts of products 1 and 2 need to be converted into the characteristics they deliver.  In Figure 5, each purchased good is a vector extending from the origin. The affordable set of characteristics in Figure 5 is contained within the triangular shaped area inside the two product vectors and the red line segment connecting the endpoints of the two vectors.  The consumer can obtain any point inside this triangle by buying goods 1 and 2 in the appropriate combination.  The __*efficient consumption frontier*__ (in red) consists of combinations of products that provide the most characteristics for the consumer's dollar.  This efficient consumption frontier is analogous to the budget frontier in the neoclassical model.

###Choice in the Lancaster Model
In the Lancaster Model, the consumer's optimal choice is the bundle of goods that provides the combination of characteristics that provide him or her with the highest level of utility given the affordability constraint.  If the consumer has monotonic preferences over the two preferences, this choice will occur somewhere on the efficient consumption frontier.  In Figure 6, a consumer's indifference curves are imposed over the affordable set, and the optimal choice occurs at point E.  In this particular example, the consumer spends half of his or her budget on good 1 and half on good 2.  This happens to occur at a tangency between the line segment constituting the efficient consumption frontier and the consumer's indifference curve.  However, optimal choices need not be points of tangency in the Lancaster model even if preferences are monotonic and convex over the characteristics.  Had these preferences been drawn differently, the optimal choice could have occurred at one of the product vector endpoints.  You will see this in the example that follows.

###An Example
Consider the fictional characteristic and price data for red delicious (RD) and golden delicious (GD) apples as presented in Table 2.  As should be clear from the table, RD apples are sweeter than GD apples but GD apples are crispier than RD apples in this example.  Consider a consumer who purchases apples because he or she values the attributes of sweetness and crispiness.  

***

####Table 2.  Fictional Characteristic and Price Data for the Apple Example

Characteristic|Red Delicious (RD) Apple | Golden Delicious (GD) Apple
----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------
Crispiness      | 1 unit                | 2 units
Sweetness       | 2 units               | 1 unit

***

The information in Table 2 is reflected below in Demonstration 3.  As shown in the demonstration, the price of each type of apple is initially \$6 per unit and the consumer has an initial budget of \$30 that is used to purchase apples ($M = \$30$).  If the consumer spends all of the \$30 budget on RD apples, he or she could obtain five RD apples in total.  Multiplying this total by the value of the characteristics per apple indicates that these five RD apples would provide a total of five units of crispiness and 10 units of sweetness.  Similarly, if the consumer spends all the budget on GD apples, he or she could obtain five GD apples in total, which would provide 10 units of crispiness and five units of sweetness.  This sets up the initial values in the demonstration.

Use Demonstration 3 to adjust the income and the price of the apples.  Make note of the following features from the demonstration:

  1. The efficient consumption frontier can collapse to a point if one of the products becomes noncompetitive.  To see this, change the RD price to \$5 and set the GD price to $12.50.  In this case, a consumer that cared only about crispiness could still get more crispiness by buying RD apples.  RD apples dominate GD apples in terms of both crispiness and sweetness meaning that GD is priced out of the market.  Similarly, if you set the RD price to \$12.50 and the GD price to \$5, the efficient consumption frontier collapses to a point that includes only GD apples. GD apples become the most efficient mechanism by which to obtain both sweetness and crispiness and RD is priced out of the market.

  2. An increase in price causes the product vector to contract radially towards the origin.  

  3. A decrease in price causes the product vector to expand radially away from the origin.  

  4. A change in income causes both vectors to contract or expand proportionately. The efficient consumption frontier shifts in the same direction of the income change.  If both products are competitive, the new efficient consumption frontier is parallel to the old.

Now let us complicate the example by assuming that Fuji apples have all the sweetness of a RD apple and all the crispiness of a GD apple.  The characteristics of the Fuji apple are presented in Table 3 below.  This is clearly a better apple, but let us assume that it is also more costly to grow.  In Demonstration 4, the Fuji apple is priced initially at \$10. Notice that at \$10, the Fuji apple is not on the efficient consumption frontier.  Even though it is a better apple in terms of its attributes, it is too costly and is not market feasible at \$10.  Consumers can obtain more of the characteristics in question by purchasing RD apples, GD apples, or some combination thereof.

If the price of the Fuji apples is reduced to \$8 in Demonstration 4, it becomes competitive with the other two apples.  At an even lower price of \$7, Fuji apples start to push out the efficient frontier, causing it to kink.  In this case, the Fuji apple becomes the best choice for those consumers who like a balance of crispiness and sweetness.  Note that RD and GD apples are still on the frontier when Fuji apples are priced at \$7.  This is because consumers who have strong preferences for sweetness but not crispiness or strong preferences for crispiness but not sweetness may still find it optimal to purchases bundles with RD or GD apples, respectively.  

This is illustrated in Figure 6 below.  Figure 6, shows indifference curves for three consumers.  One consumer has the horizontal indifference curves shown in blue.  This consumer cares only about sweetness and nothing about crispiness.  His or her utility is maximized by purchasing all RD apples because this provides the largest amount of sweetness.  Another consumer has the vertical indifference curves shown in yellow.  This consumer cares only about crispiness and nothing about sweetness.  He or she maximizes utility by purchasing only GD Apples.  The consumer with the typically shaped and strictly convex indifference curves shown in green likes both crispiness and sweetness.  He or she maximizes utility by purchasing the Fuji apples.

###Hedonic Pricing Models
In Lancaster's framework, characteristics are the things that matter in the consumer's utility function.  The consumer gets characteristics by purchasing goods and services that contain them.  When a market price is observed, the price is for a product that probably reflects a number of characteristics.  You cannot observe the value of individual characteristics directly. Continuing the automobile example above, the price of the automobile reflects horsepower along with several other characteristics.  You may observe that cars with higher horsepower also tend to have higher price tags.  This suggests that it should be possible to construct a model to get an estimate of the implicit price for horsepower.  Such a model is called a hedonic pricing model.  A hedonic pricing model could be specified as follows:

$$p = f(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_M),$$

where $p$ is price of the product in question and $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_M$ are levels of different characteristics.  

A hedonic pricing model can be used to obtain the implicit marginal value of a characteristic.  For example, if $p$ is the price of an automobile and $c_1$ is horsepower, then $\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta c_1}$ (the slope coefficient for $c_1$) is the increase in automobile price that one would expect to result from increasing horsepower by a small amount.

As an example, suppose that you were asked to specify a hedonic pricing model for retail strip steaks.  You might use something such as 

$$p = f(weight, thickness, color, quality, freshness)$$.  

You could measure weight (g) and thickness (cm).  There are techniques for quantifying color and quality could be measured in terms of internal marbling and/or through a series of binary (0 or 1) variables to control for USDA quality grade (prime, choice, select, and so forth).  These grades take marbling into account.  Freshness might be measured in terms of days remaining before the "sale by" date.  

A hedonic pricing model provides information about the returns that could be expected by improvements to one or more of the characteristics.  In the case of our retail strip steak, it may be possible to increase freshness by using vacuum packaging.  Before investing in such a technology, it would be nice to know how much consumers would be willing to pay for this product improvement.  Vacuum packaging could darken the color and result in a steak that is purplish rather than a bright red.  It is possible that despite enhanced freshness, consumers would pay less for vacuum packed steaks because they view the darker color to be undesirable.  A hedonic pricing model could be very useful decision tool in this type of a situation.

#<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Becker's (1965) Household Production Model</span>

Another model of consumer behavior is Becker's (1965) household production model. Here, the consumer has a utility function that depends on two things:

1.  household produced goods and services, and 
2.  time spent in leisure activities.  

To illustrate the idea of Becker's model, suppose that the household produced good in question is a meal.  To be more specific, let us suppose this meal consists of pasta with a marinara sauce. Ultimate utility comes from consuming the meal.  However, in order to obtain this utility, the consumer will need to: 

1. purchase ingredients from the marketplace,
2. spend time in the kitchen and dining room, and
3. have some knowledge about cooking.  This can be called human capital.  

A key point of the Becker model is that items the consumer buys at the supermarket provide him or her with no utility *per se*. In other words, Inputs such as a bag of pasta, tomatoes, garlic cloves, and oregano leaves do not satisfy the consumer. Satisfaction is not obtained until these ingredients have been combined with time and human capital to produce a meal. 

Almost any human activity could be characterized in terms of the household production model. Even a good night's rest could be viewed as household production. A good night's requires purchased inputs (shelter, a bed, linens, and possibly sleeping pills). It requires an investment in time (normally 6 to 8 hours). Finally, it might require some human capital (the ability to clear one's mind of the pressures of the day and relax into sleep). Similarly a sporting event, like a  football game, could be characterized as another household produced good. This requires purchased inputs (tickets, television, cable or satellite subscription, snacks), time (several hours), and human capital (some knowledge of the rules and strategies of the game).  The point being made here is that the household production idea is broadly applicable to human activities.  However, in actual implementations of the Becker model, activities such as sleep or enjoying sporting events might be lumped into leisure time.  

It would be wrong to suppose that only activities within the home would classify as household production and fall within the Becker framework. Suppose that instead of making the pasta dinner in the home kitchen, the consumer decides to purchase it from a restaurant. Utility is ultimately derived from consuming the prepared meal. In this case, the consumer requires purchased goods (transportation to the restaurant and a pasta dinner ordered from the menu). The consumer must also invest time to enjoy the meal. Human capital in the case of a restaurant meal involves knowledge about quality and service of competing restaurants and related products that go along with the meal (e.g., a suitable beverage or appetizer that complements the main course). Even though a restaurant meal is not "homemade", it could easily conceptualize it within the household production model.

The formal elements of the Becker model include a utility function:

$$U = f[(hh\ produced\ goods), (leisure\ time)]$$

The consumer maximizes utility subject to:

1. A hh production function: 
$$hh\ goods = g[(time\ in\ hh\ production), (market\ goods), (human\ capital)]$$

2. Income-use constraint: 

$$money\ income \ge spending\ on\ market\ goods$$

3. Income-source constraint: 

$$money\ income = (wage) \times (time\ in\ labor\ force) + (other\ income)$$

4. Time-use constraint:  
$$total\ time = (time\ in\ hh\ production) + (time\ in\ labor\ force) + (leisure\ time)$$

A main advantage of Becker's model is that it incorporates the value of the consumer's time. The income-use constraint in the Becker model is essentially the same as in the neoclassical model. The consumer cannot spend more on purchased inputs than his or her available income.  However, the model differs in that it incorporates where the consumer gets income (the income-source constraint) along with the potential uses for the consumer's time.  The income-use, income-source, and time-use constraints can be combined into one overall constraint known as the full time-income constraint below.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(wage)\times(total\ time)+(other\ income) \ge\ & (wage)\times(time\ in\ hh\ production)+ \\&(wage)\times(leisure\ time)+(spending\ on\ market\ goods)
\end{aligned}
$$


The left side of the full time-income constraint represents income potential.  The right side of the full time-income constraint represents how income potential is used.

A key insight from Becker's model for food marketing is that time spent in the kitchen has a very real cost. Many consumers are spending more time in the workforce to generate income. They are using this income to save time in household production by buying goods that require minimal preparation. Senauer, Asp, and Kinsey (1991) make a distinction between time-intensive goods and expenditure-intensive goods. A cake from the bakery costs more money than a couple of cups of flour, vegetable oil, eggs, and a bit of baking powder and cocoa. However, when you consider the opportunity cost of making a cake from scratch, the bakery cake might be the cheapest way to obtain this good. In this example, the bakery cake is an expenditure-intensive good while the raw ingredients to make a cake from scratch are time-intensive goods. 

One of the best examples of Becker's model in action is the growth in food-away-from-home expenditures (the overwhelming majority of which is accounted for by food consumed at restaurants) relative to growth in food purchased for at-home consumption.  Figure 8 shows these data from 1970 through 2014.  In 2014 food-away from home expenditures actually surpassed food-at-home expenditures.  Insights from Becker's model are also reflected in the product assortments contained in supermarkets.  New or recently renovated supermarkets tend to have larger deli and prepared food sections.

#<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Concluding Comments</span>

Market demand arises from the decisions of consumers.  The aim of this chapter has been to provide background on three consumer choice models relevant to food demand.  Each is based on the simple idea that consumers choose the best bundle that they can afford.  The models differ in terms of how consumer utility is specified and how affordable sets are characterized.  

In the neoclassical model of consumer choice, the consumer derives satisfaction directly from goods and services acquired in the marketplace.  Affordability is defined as the set of product bundles the consumer can purchase with his or her money income.  It was shown that given several reasonable assumptions, the neoclassical model of consumer choice can be used to derive individual demand schedules that have properties similar to market demand schedules introduced in Chapter 1.  However, the model does not shed a great deal of light on why a consumer might prefer a particular market good or service or why he or she might prefer one product bundle to another.

Lancaster's model differs in that it focuses not on the products themselves but on the characteristics they contain.  In Lancaster's model, you learned that the consumer derives satisfaction for characteristics, for example, sensory attributes or nutrients.  Market provided goods are important to the model in that they constitute the delivery mechanism for the attributes desired by the consumer.  Thus, Lancaster's model can provide additional insight into attributes of products that influence the consumer's desire for them.  Lancaster's model provides theoretical underpinnings for hedonic pricing models.  The logic of Lancaster's model is particularly suited to products that are in a state of latent demand as described in chapter 1.  The Lancaster framework permits a a new product innovation to be compared to existing products in the characteristic space and can provide insight into whether the new product would be competitive at a price that justifies its production cost.  Many product design activities in the food marketing system can be viewed within the context of Lancaster's model examples include fortification of food offering and the design of product offerings with reduced fat, sodium and/or sugar content.  

Finally, Becker's model differs in that market-sourced products are used as inputs for household production.  Time is essential to understanding affordable set in Becker's model, which explicitly accounts for the opportunity costs of household-produced goods.  The consumer's time allocation directly effects his/or her ability to secure products in the marketplace.  Becker's model provides a useful template to understand growth in convenience foods over recent decades.  Time spent in household production has a clear opportunity cost in the form of time not spent in the labor force and the value of foregone utility from leisure.  As opportunities for women to work outside of the home have increased markedly in the post World-War-II era, the food system has responded by increasing product offerings that reduce preparation time.
