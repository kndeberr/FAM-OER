##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Objectives</span>

* Explain the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard that result from information asymmetries.

* Explain the role of advertising to facilitate transactions that involve costly information, asymmetric information, or some combination of the two.

* Distinguish between default-independent and default-contingent signals, provide examples of each, and describe situations where each may be effective.

* Explain the concept of a separating equilibrium and why it is important to the functioning of economic signals.


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Costly Information</span>

* In many real world cases, information is not freely available.  

* Buyer must search for availability of goods and the prices at which they are being offered.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Asymmetric Information</span>
* Asymmetric information describes situations wherein one party to the transaction has more information about the product or service in question than another party.

* Adverse Selection (Hidden information problem)


* Moral Hazard (Hidden action problem)


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Market Solutions to Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard</span>

* For Moral Hazard, the market solution is to monitor the other party or develop contracts that provide incentives.  
    + Many sales associates are compensated, at least in part, on commissions
    + Broiler contracts compensate growers based on feed conversion

* Market solution to adverse selection problems is to screen products or rely on an economic signal.  


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Advertising as Information</span>

*  Traditionally, it was taken for granted that the purpose of advertising was to make the demand curve less elastic and thereby provide sellers with more discretion in setting prices.  

* Advertising can address costly information problems

* Advertising can also be a signal that addresses adverse selection problems

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Types of Product Characteristics</span>

* Search characteristics (advertising reduces costly search)

    + Search characteristics refer to aspects of a product that can readily be assessed by inspection prior to sale. However, advertising can reduce costly search.  

    + Credence characteristics (e.g., organic, cage-free, etc.) are turned into search attributes through trusted third-party audit mechanisms.

* Experience characteristics (advertising could be a signal)

    + Experience characteristics are known to customers only through use of the product and cannot be determined by inspection prior to sale.  
    
    + Asymmetric information can be a major problem when it comes to experience characteristics.

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Advertising Can Address Both Search and Experience Characteristics</span>

* Advertising can clearly play a role when it comes to helping consumers become informed about search characteristics.  

* However, many advertisements do not appear to meaningfully address search characteristics

* Nelson (1974) argued that when it comes to experience characteristics, advertising can also be informative.  He argued that advertising is information regardless of whether the advertisement is informative.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">The Logic of Advertising as a Signal</span>

Let us consider a market with the following features: 

1. There is asymmetric information wherein sellers have more information about the quality of their products than do buyers.  

2. Buyers are aware that they have less information and are naturally wary of adverse selection problems.  As a result, buyers discount quality claims made by sellers.  

* The high-quality seller needs some way to convince the skeptical buyer that the product she is selling indeed does provide high quality.  

* The high-quality seller must convince the buyer that it would be against her interest to use asymmetric information to her advantage.  That is, the seller needs to convince buyers that it would not make sense for her to charge a high-quality price for a low-quality product.  

* An extravagant advertising campaign is something that is visible to the buyer and something that the buyer will presumably understand to be costly.  

* The buyer might reason that if the seller is spending an obscene amount of money on an advertisement, the seller must have good quality because the only way to recoup the advertising outlay would be to generate repeat purchases.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">An Effective Signal Requires a Seperating Equilibrium</span>

* For a signal of any sort to work, it must be that high-quality firms find it advantageous to signal (e.g., to advertise) and low-quality firms find signalling to be against their economic interest.  

* When there is a separating equilibrium, the only thing customers need to do is to identify which firms are sending the signal and which firms are not.  Customers are informed of quality differences merely by observing which firms signal.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">A Formal Model of Signals with Two Firm Types</span>

* The first type is a high-quality firm.  This firm is capable of producing high-quality products but must incur extra production costs if it decides to produce high quality.  Because of asymmetric information, the high-quality firm might cheat customers by charging a high-quality price for low-quality products.  

* The second type of firm is a low-quality firm.  This firm is only capable of producing low quality.  Because of asymmetric information, the low-quality firm might deceive customers by offering its low-quality products at a high-quality price.  

* There is a demand for both high-quality and low-quality products.  The high-quality demand is comprised of quality-sensitive customers who are willing to pay a premium for quality.  The low-quality market is comprised of quality-insensitive customers who are unwilling to pay a premium for quality.  


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Profit outcomes in the model</span>

1.  $\pi(P_H,H)$ is the profit level of a high-quality firm that sells at the high-quality price and truthfully provides high quality (and incurs extra production costs).

2.  $\pi(P_H,L)$ is the profit level of a high or low-quality firm that is untruthful.  It sells at the high-quality price but actually provides customers with a low-quality product.  

3.  $\pi(P_L,L)$ the profit level of a high or low-quality firm that truthfully provides low quality.

4.  $\pi(P_L,H)$ is the profit of a high-quality firm who provides high quality (and incurs extra production costs) but sells at the low-quality price.  

We will rule out the fourth case by assuming $\pi(P_L,H) < 0$. That is, it is never profitable for a high-quality firm to produce a high-quality product but sell at the low-quality price.  Thus, cases 1 to 3 are the only ones of interest in our model.

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Conditions for a Lemons Market</span>

* Given asymmetric information, a lemons market could occur if: 

A.  There is an incentive for high-quality firms to cheat by providing low quality at the high-quality price.  In other words, $\pi(P_H,L)>\pi(P_H,H)$.  In this case, the incentive to cheat is the difference $\pi(P_H,L)-\pi(P_H,H) > 0$,

and/or

B.  There is an incentive for low-quality firms to deceive by pretending to be high-quality firms.  In other words, $\pi(P_H,L)>\pi(P_L,L)$.  In this case, the incentive to deceive is $\pi(P_H,L)-\pi(P_L,L) > 0$.

* With either or both of these incentives in place, customers would be wary of any firm that charges the high-quality price.  


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">A Signal to Correct the Lemons Problem</span>

* Define $C$ as the signal cost of a firm that provides high quality and define $C^\prime$ be the signal cost of a firm that provides low quality and we will require that $C^\prime > C$ .  

* Condition 1.  Access to the high-quality market is economically attractive in the presence of a truthful signal. 

$$\pi(P_H,H)- C>\pi(P_L,L)$$
which implies

$$\pi(P_H,H) - \pi(P_L,L) > C$$

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">A Signal to Correct the Lemons Problem (Continued)</span>

* Define $C$ as the signal cost of a firm that provides high quality and define $C^\prime$ be the signal cost of a firm that provides low quality and we will require that $C^\prime > C$ .  


* Condition 2:  The signal removes the incentive for high-quality firms to cheat.  It must be that:

$$\pi(P_H,H)- C>\pi(P_H,L) - C^\prime$$

which implies

$$C^\prime - C > \pi(P_H,L) - \pi(P_H,H)$$



##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">A Signal to Correct the Lemons Problem (Continued)</span>

* Define $C$ as the signal cost of a firm that provides high quality and define $C^\prime$ be the signal cost of a firm that provides low quality and we will require that $C^\prime > C$ .  

* Condition 3: The signal removes the incentive for low-quality firms to deceive.  It must be that:

3A.   $\pi(P_L,L)>\pi(P_H,L) - C^\prime$,

which implies

3B. $C^\prime> \pi(P_H,L) - \pi(P_L,L)$.

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">A Signal to Correct the Lemons Problem (Concluded)</span>

* If all three of these conditions hold, we will have a separating equilibrium where high-quality firms will signal and truthfully provide high-quality and low-quality firms will not signal and will provide low quality.  

* Consumers who are willing to pay a premium for quality can safely purchase from firms with the signal.  

* Consumers who are not quality conscious will buy from firms that do not signal.  In short, the signal corrects the lemons market problem and allows for the high-quality market to exist.  

* If any one of these three conditions do not hold, however, there is no separating equilibrium and the signal is ineffective.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Default-independent signals (Kirmani and Rao 2010)</span>  
* Advertising
* Low introductory prices
* Investments in brand equity defined broadly
* Coupons
* Slotting allowances (up front payments by food manufacturers to retailers to carry their products).  
* Repeat sales are very important to default-independent signals.  
* For non-durable and frequently purchased items (like food products) default-independent signals are common.

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Default-contingent signals (Kirmani and Rao 2010)</span>
* Warranties 
* High selling price
* The firm makes no significant initial investment in the default-contingent signal.  If quality turns out to be bad, however, the firm stands to faces costs associated with the signal.

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Potential for Customer Abuse and Other Limitations of Signals</span>

* Customers could abuse warranty claims

* A low introductory price it is likely to attract quality insensitive customers who will not be repeat purchasers once the promotion ends
