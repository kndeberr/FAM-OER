##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Objectives</span>

* Explain the four components of a price series.

* Use index numbers to account for inflation and express monetary values in constant dollars.  

* Compute an N-period moving average to remove the seasonal component from a price series.

* Distinguish between demand and supply induced seasonality and be able to provide examples of each.

* Describe conditions that are likely to give rise to price cycles.


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Components of a Time Series</span>

1. The trend
2. The seasonal component
3. The cyclical component
4. The random component

```


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Trend </span>
* The trend is the general long-term direction of movement in the series.  

* Trends can be positive or negative

* A positive trend, such as that shown in Demonstration 1, would result when long-run demand increases (shifts out) at a higher rate than long-run supply shifts. 

* A negative trend would occur when long-run supply increases at a faster rate than long-run demand.

* One way to analyze a trend is through regression analysis. The analyst would estimate a model such as  

$$P_t = \alpha + \beta t + \epsilon_t,$$
where $P_t$ is the price at time $t$, $\alpha$ is the average price over the period analyzed, $\beta$ is the trend coefficient, and $\epsilon$ is an error term.  



##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Accounting for Inflation</span>

* Inflation refers to general increases in price levels over time.  
* Deflation, by contrast, refers to general decreases in price levels over time.  
* Because of inflation and deflation, the purchasing power of the dollar differs from year to year.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Real (Constant) vs. Nominal (Current) Prices</span>

* Nominal (or current) prices are what consumers actually paid for a product at the time of purchase.  

* The adjectives, "nominal" or "current" apply to any monetary value that has not been adjusted for inflation, e.g., nominal incomes, nominal tuition costs, nominal health care costs. 

* Real (or constant) prices, by contrast, always refer to prices in terms of the purchasing power of the dollar in some reference year.  

* For example, if I see a note indicating that prices are in real or constant 1990 dollars, this tells me that:

1. 	I am dealing with real not nominal prices, i.e., the prices are adjusted for inflation, and
2.	Prices reflect the purchasing power of the dollar in 1990.  


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Converting Nominal (Current) Values into Real (Constant) Values</span>

* To convert any nominal price to a real price we need a broad price index that measures inflation.  

* The most common index used in the United States is the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U).  

* The CPI-U reflects the prices that consumers pay over a broad category of expense items including, food, housing, transportation, apparel, health care, education, and so forth 

Given a broad price index like the CPI-U, we can convert nominal prices into real prices via the following formula:

$$Real\ Price = \frac{Nominal\ Price}{Index}\times 100$$


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Table 1. Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (1982-84 = 100), Selected Years</span>
Year | CPI-U
-----|-------
1960 |  29.6
1965 |  31.5
1970 |  38.8
1975 |  53.8
1980 |  82.4
1982 |  96.5
1983 |  99.6
1984 | 103.9
1985 | 107.6
1990 | 130.7
1995 | 152.4
2000 | 172.2
2005 | 195.3
2010 | 218.1
2015 | 237.0
2016 | 240.0


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Interpretting Index Numbers</span>

*  The numbers in Table 1 present price levels as a percentage of the 1982-84 base period.  

* In 2000, the CPI is 172.2.  This means that general price levels in 2000 were (172.2 - 100) = 72.2 percent higher than they were during the 1982-84 base period.  

* In 2016 the index is 240.0. Price levels in 2016 were (240-100) = 140 percent higher than in the 1982-84 base period.

* In 1980, the value of the index is 82.4.  This means that price levels were (82.4-100) = -17.6 percent higher (or 17.6 percent lower) than they were during the 1982-84 base period.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Using the CPI to Convert Nominal Prices to Real Prices</span>

$$Real\ Price = \frac{Nominal\ Price}{Index}\times 100$$
Table 2. Converting Bread Prices from Nominal to Real Terms

Year | Nominal Price | Real Price (1982-84 dollars)
-----|---------------| ---------------------------
1970 |    $0.24$     |  $\frac{\$0.24}{38.8}\times 100 = \$0.62$  
2016 |    $1.40$     |  $\frac{\$1.40}{240.0}\times 100 = \$0.58$

* These real prices reflect the purchasing power of the dollar in the 1982-84 base period

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Changing the Base Period</span>

* We can easily change the base period of any price index.  All you need to do is 
1. choose a new base period, 
2. divide the index numbers in all periods by the value of the original index in your new base period, and
3. multiply the resulting new index by 100.  

$$I_{2016 = 100}^t = \frac{I_{1982-84 = 100}^t}{I_{1982-84 = 100}^{2016}}\times 100$$

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Table 3. Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers</span>
Year | 1982-84=100 | 2016=100
-----|-------------|------------
1970 |  38.8       |   16.2
1980 |  82.4       |   34.3
1990 | 130.7       |   54.5
2000 | 172.2       |   71.7
2010 | 218.1       |   90.9
2016 | 240.0       |  100.0


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Real prices in 2016 dollars</span>

* If we use this transformed index (2016=100) to adjust for inflation, we will obtain a real price series that reflects the purchasing power of the dollar in 2016.  

Table 4. Real and Nominal Prices for Bread

Year   | Nominal Price | Real Price (2016 = 100)
-------|---------------| ---------------------------
$1970$ |    $0.24$     |  $\frac{0.24}{16.2}\times 100 = 1.48$  
$2016$ |    $1.40$     |  $\frac{1.40}{100.0}\times 100 = 1.40$

* Be sure to notice that the real price equals the nominal price in the base year.  


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Seasonal Component </span>
* A seasonal pattern is observed with regularity within a given period of time, usually within a year.  

* We are normally interested in seasonal patterns over a calendar or marketing year, but there may be contexts in which we could see regular patterns over shorter periods. 

* Seasonal patterns can be demand-induced or supply induced.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Demand-Induced Seasonality</span>

* Christmas trees, carving pumpkins, and whole turkeys.  
* In these cases, demand is driven by consumption around holidays.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Supply-Induced Seasonality</span>

* Supply-induced seasonal patterns are observed in the market for perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables.  
* These crops are often sourced from different regions of the country or world during different parts of the year.  
* The costs of producing and shipping berries to market differ depending on the supply region.  
* Essentially the supply curve for berries differs depending on the season of the year and this leads to seasonality in the prices of these berries.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Supply-Induced Seasonality for Storable Commodities</span>
* Storage costs can result in supply-induced seasonal price patterns for storable commodities like grains and oilseeds.  

* These crops are harvested once a year, but demand is spread over the year.  It is often the case that prices are lowest around the harvest season but then increase in the following months.  

* The increase in price is necessary to provide incentives to store commodities and make them available for use in non-harvest months.

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Removing Seasonality with a Moving Average</span>

* An n-period moving average is an average of the n most recent time series observations.  

* If one chooses n to correspond to the periodicity of the data, a moving average can be used to remove the seasonal component of a time series, which may help you better see the trend or cyclical components.  

    + Use a four-period average for quarterly data
    + Use a 12-period average for monthly data
    + Use a 52-period average for weekly data

lines(4:16,4:16*2,lwd=3,col="red")
```


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Cyclical Component </span>
* A cyclical pattern repeats with some regularity over several years.  Cyclical patterns differ from seasonal patterns in that cyclical patterns occur over multiple years, whereas seasonal patterns occur within one year.  

* In Demonstration 1 above one full cycle from a peak in quarter 1 to another peak in quarter 22.  Thus, the cycle shown lasts about 5.5 years.  

##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Agricultural Price Cycles </span>

* Cycles are also observed in some agricultural commodity prices and are most pronounced when there is a time lapse between a change in price and the producer's response to this change. The time lapse is due to two things:

1. __*A biological lag*__.   The biological lag refers to the length of time between the decision to expand production and the resulting change in supply. 
2. __*A psychological lag*__.  The psychological lag is the length of time when prices must be high or low in order to convince producers that production plans should be changed.

* Price cycles emerge when future production decisions are based on current prices.  
* Cycles are more likely to emerge in industries where there are a large number of relatively small operations.  
* Price cycles are also more likely when there is a a large degree of control over output.  Otherwise, random shocks tend to disrupt the cyclical pattern and cause it to dissipate.

The feeder cattle price series shown is constructed as the simple average of daily nearby feeder cattle futures prices by calendar month.  


##<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Random Component </span>

* Movements in a time series that cannot be explained by the trend, seasonal, or cyclical components are considered to be random.  
* Many exogenous factors can cause demand or supply to shift and the equilibrium price to change.  
* In agriculture, these include weather, plant or animal diseases, political upheavals that affect trade, and a number of other shocks to demand or supply.  
* A moving average as described above can help to remove random elements of the time series as well as seasonality.
